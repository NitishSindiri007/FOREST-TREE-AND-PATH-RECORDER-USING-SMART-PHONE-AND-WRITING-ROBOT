## Abstract
In this project the moving path covered by the user in forests area is recorded in the near by camp. In this we have a forest way instruction recorder using voice recognition used to record the path covered by the user and send the data of path to the near by camp using bluetooth.Previously XY Plotter is entirely dependent on older CNC Machines. These machines are capable to write and draw the critical structures with the exact output. Now with the help of Arduino Nano controller, CNC shield driver with stepper motors, servo motor makes the entire process complete with promising results.
